In order to appreciate wonderful features and benefits of container technlogies, it is good to step back and understand some key apspects of business problems where any new apporach to IT management answers and resolve these areas.  

# Understand key aspects of IT management

The fundamental management of IT resources is looking for simlar areas below no matter how IT tecnhonlogies are evolving.
Some examples of questions below are commonly examined.

  - How IT resources could be provisioned quicker?

# How IT management has been evolved? 

1. Centralized IT resources   

IT infrastruce used to be very popular to have centralised, highend of computing units such as Mainframe which co$t$ a lot of IT spending on IT infrastructure and all resources are centrally managed and controlled by specialists or system administrators. 
 

2. Distributed IT resources - standalone/workstations/servers 

Instead of setting up huge towers of $$$ high-end computing units, spitting computing units into smaller units per buniess needs. It was a common approch to set up servers here and there for specific buniess applications such as a server for a web server, another for application server, another one for database servers, etc. 

While it gives flexibility and isolation of business applications, this "one-server-one-application/fuction" approach is commonly observed that IT resources are under utilized because it must be estimated and planed for the multi-year growth of future demands. 

IT resources are pretty much spending a lot for computing units but the initial usage is not efficiently utilised. 


3. Virtualization
